# Imcrypt

<h2>A unique method of encryption, using images as distinct generation for entropy. </h2> 

<p> Basic functionality is working, pretty featureless but works as follows:

Usage: 
python main.py encrypt image.png file.txt secret.imc
python main.py decrypt image.png secret.imc file_out.txt

The file type is not specific, can use any format for in and out.

TESTED WORKING RIGHT NOW: text, images

will add more to this soon when not lazy :p -ryan
